Based on the current state of Quant Commander and industry best practices for financial data analysis, here are the most impactful next analyses to focus on:

🎯 Recommended Next Analysis: Outlier Detection
Why Outlier Detection Should Be Next:
🔍 Immediate Business Value: Identifies anomalies, fraud, exceptional performance, and data quality issues
🤖 AI Integration Opportunity: Perfect for leveraging your Ollama LLM to explain why outliers occurred
📊 Complements Existing Analyzers: Works synergistically with Top N, Trend, and Period Variance analysis
⚡ High Impact, Moderate Complexity: Provides significant insights without being overly complex to implement
Outlier Detection Features to Implement:
🔢 Statistical Methods:

Z-Score detection (configurable thresholds)
Interquartile Range (IQR) method
Modified Z-Score for small datasets
Isolation Forest for multivariate outliers
📈 Time-Series Outliers:

Seasonal decomposition outliers
Moving average deviation detection
Change point detection
Contextual outliers (unusual for time period)
🧠 Intelligent Classification:

Positive outliers (exceptionally good performance)
Negative outliers (concerning anomalies)
Contextual outliers (unusual for specific conditions)
Collective outliers (groups of unusual data points)
🎨 Visualization & Insights:

Box plots with highlighted outliers
Time series charts with anomaly markers
Confidence intervals and threshold visualization
AI-generated explanations for each outlier
📋 Alternative Analysis Options (In Priority Order):
2. 📊 Contribution Analysis
Purpose: Shows what percentage each category contributes to totals
Value: Essential for understanding composition and identifying key drivers
Complexity: Low-Medium
Features: Hierarchical breakdowns, waterfall charts, percentage calculations
3. 🔗 Correlation Analysis
Purpose: Identifies relationships between different metrics
Value: Reveals hidden patterns and dependencies in data
Complexity: Medium
Features: Correlation matrices, scatter plots, strength indicators
4. 📅 Seasonal Analysis
Purpose: Detects recurring patterns and seasonal trends
Value: Critical for forecasting and planning
Complexity: Medium-High
Features: Seasonal decomposition, yearly patterns, holiday effects
5. 📈 Forecast Variance Analysis
Purpose: Compares forecasted vs actual vs budget performance
Value: Measures prediction accuracy and planning effectiveness
Complexity: Medium
Features: Three-way variance, accuracy metrics, confidence intervals
🚀 Implementation Strategy for Outlier Detection:
Phase 1: Core Detection Engine
Phase 2: Multi-Column Intelligence
Detect outliers across multiple dimensions simultaneously
Cross-reference with existing Top N and Trend analysis results
Provide contextual explanations ("This outlier coincides with Q3 peak performance")
Phase 3: AI-Powered Insights
Use Ollama to generate explanations for why outliers occurred
Suggest follow-up questions and investigations
Provide recommendations for handling different types of outliers
💡 Why This Progression Makes Sense:
Building on Success: Leverages the column intelligence system you've already built
User Workflow: Outliers naturally complement Top N analysis (users often want to know "what's unusual?")
Technical Foundation: Uses similar statistical concepts and data processing patterns
Business Impact: Outlier detection is one of the most requested features in financial analysis
🤔 Your Decision:
Which analysis direction interests you most? I can provide detailed implementation plans for:

🔍 Outlier Detection (recommended) - High impact, moderate complexity
📊 Contribution Analysis - Quick win, high business value
🔗 Correlation Analysis - Advanced insights, medium complexity
📅 Seasonal Analysis - Complex but powerful for time-series data

Scalability Assessment Summary
🎯 ANSWER: Yes, your Top N analysis will scale to 1M rows, but with important considerations.

Key Findings:
✅ WILL WORK: Current implementation is well-architected

Algorithm complexity: O(n + k log k) - very efficient
Memory usage: ~2-3GB for 1M rows (within browser limits)
Processing time: 10-30 seconds (acceptable for batch analysis)
**⚠️ PERFORMANCE CHARACTERISTICS:

<100K rows: Excellent (under 1 second)
100K-500K rows: Good (1-10 seconds)
500K-1M rows: Acceptable (10-30 seconds)
1M+ rows: Requires optimization
**🔧 IMMEDIATE NEEDS FOR 1M ROWS:

Progress indicators (essential for user experience)
Memory usage warnings
Dataset size detection and user warnings
"Cancel" functionality for long operations
**💡 OPTIMIZATION OPPORTUNITIES:

Chunk-based processing (50K row chunks)
Web Workers (move computation off main thread)
Smart sampling (analyze representative subset)
Server-side processing for premium users
